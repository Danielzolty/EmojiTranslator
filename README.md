# EmojiTranslator

TCP chat between 2 different servers where one could have language translated into any other language with emojis inlcuded. 
It is based on speech-recognition library, so one could speak into the chat server and it will deliver the message in whatever language desired. 

Additionally, there is an online video chat component set up as well. One could take have a video of oneself where their speech is being transliterated in english.

Emoji_Translator files are hidden in a submodule, so I uploaded relevent files in Transcript_With-Emojis.
